    Multi Depot Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP) for Qubots.

    In this problem, a fleet of trucks (with uniform load capacity and route duration capacity)
    is available at several depots. Each customer has a known demand and requires a certain service time.
    Trucks must serve customers such that:
      - Each customer is served exactly once.
      - The total demand on any truck does not exceed its capacity.
      - The total time spent on a route (travel distance plus service times) does not exceed the truck's route duration capacity.
    In addition, a depot is considered opened (and incurs a fixed cost) if at least one truck departs from it.
    
    **Candidate Solution Representation:**
      A dictionary with key "routes" mapping to a two-dimensional list of size [nb_depots][nb_trucks_per_depot],
      where each element is a list of customer indices (0-indexed) representing the sequence of customers served by that truck.
